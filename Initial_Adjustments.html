    <title>Initial Adjustments</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Initial Adjustments:</h2>
    <p>For initial adjustments I recommend the following:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Disconnect ribbon cable between the OS and FCFE PCBs.</li>
      <li>If possible,&nbsp; connect power to the amplifier through a
        Variac.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Output Stage Adjustment:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Trimmer P4 adjusts Vds, the voltage between drain and source,
        of the 2SK182ES SIT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is particularly
        important the the voltage between node S, the SIT source pin,
        and ground be within the voltage range of the output
        electrolytic capacitor C5.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two alternative
        power configurations: <br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>positive and negative rails: The voltage at Node S should be
          negative at around -2V to -5V.</li>
        <li>ground and negative rails: The voltage at Node S should be
          negative at around 1/2 the voltage of the negative rail.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Trimmer P5 adjusts the OS idle current, which is determined by
        the voltage across the IXTN40PN50P PFET drain sense resistor(s)
        R22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For idle current Ibias, the voltage
        across R22 should be V(R22) = 0.097*Ibias.&nbsp; In the
        prototype SIT3X, I have adjusted for V(R22)=180mV, thus Ibias=
        1.856A.&nbsp;&nbsp; DiyAudio Store 5U 400mm chassis, the maximul
        value for Ibias is estimated to be about 1.6A or V(R22)=0.155V.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Start with the P4 and P5 CCW, assuming the trimmers are correctly
      oriented.&nbsp; P5 center tap to the Opto LED anode resistance
      should be near zero.&nbsp; P4 center tap to top of R24 should be
      near zero.</p>
    <p>Two voltage measurements must be monitored while adjusting P4 and
      P5, and is best done using two multimeters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Connect
      one multimeter between V(S) the DC voltage between the SIT source
      pin, and ground.&nbsp; Connect the other multimeter across
      R22.&nbsp; These adjustments strongly interact with a fairly long
      time constant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Apply power through the Variac initially at a low voltage and
        increase while monitoring the two voltage measurements.&nbsp;
        The main thing to look for is that the idle current is nearly
        zero with P4 in the CCW position (or the CW position if the
        trimmer is backwards).&nbsp;&nbsp; The voltage at node S should
        be near zero.&nbsp;&nbsp; If these voltages look good, slowly
        increase the Variac output voltage until the nominal line
        voltage is reached.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>With the amplifier powered at normal AC line voltage,
        alternately turn P4 and P5 in the CW direction with the goal
        being to achieve V(S) = -2V to -5V, and V(R22)=0.097*Ibias.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Folded Cascode Front End Adjustment:</h3>
    <p>The FCFE has two trimmers P3FE and P4FE which adjust the currents
      through the resistors R31 and R32, which ultimately adjust the
      FCFE M1FE and M2FE FET idle currents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those
      currents are determined by measuring the voltages across the 22
      Ohm resistors R10 and R11, <b>which should be installed in a
        manner that permits the attachment of multimeter probes.&nbsp; </b>The

      idle current of M1FE is V(R10)/22R.&nbsp; In the SIT3X prototype,
      I chose a idle current of 50mA, but it can be somewhat lower. At
      50mA, V(R10)=1.1V.<br>
    </p>
    <p>With the power off, connect the ribbon cable between the OS and
      FCFE PCBs.&nbsp; State with P3FE and P4FE in the fully CCW where
      the resistance of the wiper to the end of R35b/R36b is near zero
      Ohms.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Connect one multimeter across R10 or R11, and connect the other
      multimeter between FEOut and ground.&nbsp; The adjustment goal to
      achieve near zero volts at FEOut and a value near 1.1V across
      R(10).&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Apply power to the amplifier.</li>
      <li>Alternately adjust P3FE and P4FE.&nbsp; The adjustment goal to
        achieve near zero volts at FEOut and a value near 1.1V across
        R(10).&nbsp; This is an iterative process since these
        adjustments strongly interact.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>X Pot Initial Adjustment:</h3>
    The X pot, P6 on the OS PCB, adjusts AC signal level to the PFET
    relative to that of the SIT, and has a major effect on the behavior
    of the output stage.&nbsp; For a variety of reasons I have chosen a
    particular adjustment of P6 that both sounds good to me and is
    easily achieved without needing a spectrum analyzer or other special
    equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the value where at low output
    wattage the PFET is acting as a current source and the SIT is doing
    all of the real work, as in a single-ended output stage.<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Connect an 8 Ohm load of at least 3 Watts to the the amplifier
        output.</li>
      <li>Apply a 1kHz (the frequency can be as low of 60Hz) sine wave
        signal of around 0.7Vpeak (0.5Vrms) to the amplifier input.</li>
      <li>Connect a AC voltmeter to across the R22, the PFET drain sense
        resistor.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Apply power to the amplifier.</li>
      <li>Adjust P6 for as close to zero Vac as possible.&nbsp; The
        value should be less than 1mVrms.</li>
    </ol>
