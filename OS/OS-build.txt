Parts choices:

  In SIT3X-OS-20200912.BOM and you will find some parts that have multiple choices.
  P6 can be a simple single-turn or multi-turn 100R trimmer in the OS PCB
      or a 10-turn panel mounted precision dial potentiometer.

  C5 (output electrolytic) has multiple choices.
    The only constraints are voltage, diameter, and lead spacing.

C6 has a variety of lead spacing on the PCB.  The BOM shows the cap. that I used.

  M71 can be either an IRFP240 or and IRFP260.

Construction details:

  M71 the cap multiplier FET should not be mounted to the PCB until the PCB is first attached to the heatsink.  The image in SIT3X-Build-Guide/OS/M71-lead-bending.jpg shows how the FET leads should be bent.  Attach the FET to the heatsink with a suitable insulator (silpad or mica and goop)and screw, with the FET leads inserted into the PS PCB thru holes, ans solder the leads.  

  The 2SK182ES SIT must be insulated from the heatsink using sheet mica and goop or anaother appropriate insulator.  I used mica and goop.  The mounting screews must be insulated from the SIT case.  I used DigiKey RPC6397-ND shoulder washers, but there might be better options.  For the drain connection iI used a ring terminal for #16 or larger wires and a hole big enough that the shoulder washer fits thru it into the SIT case.  Thus the drain ring terminal contacts the case, but SIT case is still insulated from the heatsink.
