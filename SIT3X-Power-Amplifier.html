    </h1>
    <h2><a name="mozTocId55839" class="mozTocH2"></a>Output Stage:</h2>
    <p>The SIT3X evolved from a discovery made during LTSpice
      simulations of variants of the FirstWatt SIT-3 topology.&nbsp;
      Simulations of the SIT-3 topology showed a weird anti push-pull
      behavior of the circuit which was strongly dependent on SIT/PFET
      device parameters and source resistors.&nbsp; Since I had a very
      limited selection of six 2SK182ES SIT devices available to select
      from, I was seeking a way control the DEFiSIT parameters with
      devices that could not work in the FirstWatt SIT-3 circuit.&nbsp;
      Another goal was to eliminate the source resistors altogether and
      obtain higher output power than that of the SIT-3.<br>
    </p>

    <h3><a name="mozTocId236461" class="mozTocH3"></a>The magic A
      attenuation factor:<br>
    </h3>
    While simulating different output stage variations, I discovered a
    topology which attenuates the AC signal to the PFET gate relative to
    that of the SIT gate, and independently controls the Vgs bias
    voltages of the FETs.&nbsp; This circuit allows the SIT operating
    point Vds and Id to be chosen freely and different attenuation
    factors <b>A</b> produce significant changes to the circuit
    behavior.&nbsp; In retrospect, I should have named the attenuation
    factor <b>X</b> for the X in SIT3<b>X</b>.&nbsp; <br>
    <blockquote>A &gt; A_J1ccs push/push (anti push/pull) behavior<br>
      A = A_J1ccs&nbsp; SIT J1 acts as constant current source at low to
      medium power levels<br>
      A = A_ACbal&nbsp; J1 and M1 have balanced AC push/pull currents<br>
      A = A_H2min&nbsp; 2nd harmonic minimized at 1W<br>
      A = A_M1ccs&nbsp; PFET M1 acts as constant current source at low
      to medium power levels<br>
      A &lt; A_M1ccs&nbsp; pull/pull (anti push/pull) behavior</blockquote>
    <p>The values for A_J1ccs, A_ACbal, A_H2min, and A_M1ccs depend on
      the device and circuit parameters, but in bench testing of the
      prototype SIT3X right channel I measured:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A_J1ccs = 0.97959<br>
        A_ACbal = did not measure<br>
        A_H2min = 0.94851<br>
        A_M1ccs = 0.92828<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3><a name="mozTocId41483" class="mozTocH3"></a>Second Harmonic
      Relative Phase:</h3>
    Simulations (and subsequent bench tests) of the SIT3X output stage
    also showed at second harmonic (H2) relative phase (as defined by
    Nelson Pass) behaved was negative for A&gt;A_H2min and positive for
    A &lt; A_H2min.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    If we wish to have negative H2 phase and operate in the A &gt;
    A_H2min we can use a (non-inverting) front end that is neutral with
    respect to H2 phase and connect the speaker terminals
    "normally".&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    If we wish to have negative H2 phase and operate in the A &lt;
    A_H2min range of values we can use a front end that inverts the
    signal and connect the speaker wires inverted.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Simulations (and subsequent bench tests) showed better harmonic
    distortion behavior in the A &lt; A_H2min.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <h3><a name="mozTocId131111" class="mozTocH3"></a>Load on the Front
      End:</h3>
    <p>
      <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
      The resistor divider (potentiometer in the circuit shown above)
      places a resistive load on the input (FEOut).&nbsp;&nbsp; Bench
      measurements show that the 2SK182ES has an input capacitance of
      approximately 19nF.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the resistive and
      capacitive loads combine to present a significant load on the
      front end circuit.&nbsp; Using simulations I picked a value of
      between 500R and 1K for the resistor divider (potentiometer in the
      schematic).<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="mozTocId516983" class="mozTocH2"></a>Front End Stage
      Circuit Alternatives:</h2>
    <p>For the SIT3X prototype I chose to use an inverting front end and
      operate in the A &lt; A_H2min range of values.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="mozTocId556366" class="mozTocH4"></a>Buffer/Step-Up
      Transformer:</h3>
    <p>The FirstWatt SIT-3 amplifier uses a JFET buffer to drive a
      step-up transformer to provide current gain and voltage gain to
      drive its SIT/PFET output stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I abandoned
      this approach because of the limited output voltage range of
      quality audio transformers.&nbsp; Multiple stacked transformers
      would be required for a front end circuit capable of more than
      about 20V peak output, and the transformers introduce significant
      distortion.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="mozTocId467921" class="mozTocH4"></a>Folded Cascode
      with Buffer:</h3>
    <p>Having studied the "John Curl's Blowtorch preamplifier" thread
      years ago, I ran simulations of circuit variations that might be
      useful for the SIT3X front end. &nbsp; One circuit from the
      Blowtorch thread is: &nbsp; <a
href="https://www.diyaudio.com/forums/solid-state/71189-john-curls-blowtorch-preamplifier-post893365.html">balanced



        folded cascode circuit.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; I found that the output
      impedance of the circuit shown was too high to drive the input
      load of the SIT3X OS, but by adding a MOSFET buffer to the circuit
      it would work very well.&nbsp; The resulting circuit topology is:<br>
