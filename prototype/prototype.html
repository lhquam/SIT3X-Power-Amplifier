    <h2><a name="mozTocId686739" class="mozTocH3"></a>PCBs:</h2>
    <p>The SIT3X prototype was built using PCBs from a small fabrication
      run of the OS and FCFE PC boards, and some left over power supply
      boards from a previous amplifier project.&nbsp;&nbsp; During bench
      tests I discovered an artwork error on the FCFE PCBs which was
      easy to fix and several other design issues on both the FCFE and
      OS PCBs that required some modifications.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these
      modifications have been incorporated into the schematics and PCBs
      shown in the <a href="#mozTocId422104">SIT3X Release</a>
      documentation.&nbsp; The release versions of the OS and FCFE PCBs
      have been tested in the prototype chassis.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="mozTocId787397" class="mozTocH3"></a>Chassis: </h2>
    <p>The SIT3X prototype uses the same simple chassis construction
      that I have used for most of my other amplifiers.&nbsp; It
      consists of two HeatsinkUSA heatsinks mounted fin-to-fin,
      supported by a 1/8" aluminum back panel and a power supply panel,
      each mounted to a galvanized bottom tray.&nbsp; The design could
      not be simpler.&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be relatively easy to add
      ventilated covers but I have not yet bothered.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>This chassis design has numerous advantages:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>simple and inexpensive to build.</li>
      <li>easy access for PCB installation and removal, pot adjustment,
        and other measurements.</li>
      <li>option for fan cooling allowing higher idle currents and rail
        voltages.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It also has some disadvantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>no place to mount a two-channel front-end PCB.</li>
      <li>aspect ratio might not be appealing to some people.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I recommend this chassis design for those looking for output
      power levels above 25 Watts into 8R. <br>

    <h2><a name="mozTocId873114" class="mozTocH3"></a>Power Supply:</h2>
    <p>I used an Antek AN-10435 1000VA transformer having two 35Vrms
      secondaries.&nbsp; I deliberately chose an oversized transformer
      to allow experimentation with bother higher than necessary rail
      voltages and higher bias currents.&nbsp;&nbsp; An 800VA
      transformer with 34Vrms secondaries would be more than adequate,
      but I would not recommend going much below 600VA and 32Vrms.&nbsp;

    <h2>Measurements:</h2>
    <h3><a name="mozTocId684789" class="mozTocH3"></a>Output Noise
      Level:<br>
    </h3>
    <p> I performed spectrum analyzer measurements and multimeter AC
      voltage measurements of the SIT3X output with RCA inputs shorted,
      and found that the noise levels depended on a variety of factors,
      the primary ones being the wiring of the rectifier/capacitor
      output grounds to the OS PCBs and the proximity of the rectifiers
      to the FCFE PCBs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The prototype chassis wiring diagram
      show the wiring configuration that produced the lowest noise
      levels after much experimentation.&nbsp; There remains an
      unexplained difference in noise levels between the channels, as
      shown in the table below.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These noise levels are
      low enough that I must have my ear next to my 85dB sensitivity
      loudspeaker cones to hear it.&nbsp; <br>

    <p>For new SIT3X builds using the prototype chassis design with the
      new single-channel capacitor boards I recommend the following
      wiring diagram.&nbsp; It is important that the wires from the star
      ground to the OS PCB grounds avoid influence from the transformer
      magnetic fields as much as possible.<br>
